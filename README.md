# Choices This is a small program that I have been working on to teach myself a little more of the front end language.
It is just a sort of "video" game That uses 20 Html divs as click points (Choices) to increase or decrese the percentage on 4 progess bars.
The object of the game is to get all progess bars to 100%
If a progress bar exceeds 100% then it is reset to 25% but the amount the bars increse or decreses will increse.
If a progress bar goes below 0% then you will lose a life. 0 lives = game over.
The game is not yet complete, but I use some HTML,CSS,Java Script and J Query in the program along with Bootstrap
It's not anything fancy, but it has given me an oppurtunity to use some progamming skills. I hope to make the game better over time.
